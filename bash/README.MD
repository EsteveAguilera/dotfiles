# About

After watching an amazing talk from [@edubxb](https://github.com/edubxb): [To CLI or not to CLI, that is the question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33uJPrrYRLI) I decided to use bash again.

The talk is in Spanish, but you can see the slides [here](http://slides.com/edubxb/to-cli-or-not-to-cli#/) (in English).

Most of the configuration files are based on the [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/edubxb/dotfiles) from [@edubxb](https://github.com/edubxb)

This configuration uses [Bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it) and [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)

## Special notes

If using mac os, don't forget to download a recent version of **Bash**, mac os cames with a really old version of Bash, and you can not update it... $%&#@

The easiest way is using **brew**

```shell
brew install bash
```
