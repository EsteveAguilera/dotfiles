# My dotfiles

## What to find here

This repo has my dotfiles configurations for [bash](https://github.com/EsteveAguilera/dotfiles/tree/master/bash), [zsh](https://github.com/EsteveAguilera/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh), and [git](https://github.com/EsteveAguilera/dotfiles/tree/master/git).

It also has some other command line stuff I use like [homebrew](https://github.com/EsteveAguilera/dotfiles/tree/master/homebrew) and some [scripts](https://github.com/EsteveAguilera/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts).

## Why create another dotfiles repo?

I started playing with my dotfiles thanks to other dofiles repos, so why not share mine too!
